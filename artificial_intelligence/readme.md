# SASL HLT Artificial Intelligence Models

This folder contains AI models, training outputs, checkpoints (e.g., `.pkl` files), and reinforcement learning scripts developed for the South African Sign Language Human Language Technology (SASL HLT) project.

## Contents

- **Model Weights and Checkpoints**  
  Trained models saved as `.pkl` or `.pt` files for reuse and transfer learning.

- **Synthetic Data Generators**  
  Tools for creating artificial sign language data with variation in handshape, motion, and demographics.

- **Reinforcement Learning Scripts**  
  Experiments using RL frameworks to simulate learning environments for SASL recognition, translation, or avatar interaction.

## Usage Notes

- **Do not use for commercial purposes** without a signed data sharing and ethical use agreement.
- Ensure **proper academic attribution** when using models or code in publications.
