# 🤟 South African Sign Language Human Language Technology (SASL HLT)

Welcome to the official repository for South African Sign Language Human Language Technology (SASL HLT), a non-commercial, open, and inclusive initiative aimed at advancing the ethical development and public access of HLT tools, datasets, and models for SASL. Rooted in Ubuntu ethics and academic rigour, this repository is maintained by researchers affiliated with the University of the Free State.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This repository is dedicated to the **development, documentation, and democratization of SASL HLT** for research, education, and public access. It aims to correct the hearing-centric bias in existing HLT systems by **prioritizing inclusive, Deaf-led design** principles. Applications such as the *Lebitso App* are part of this broader effort to empower the South African Deaf community and promote linguistic justice.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```plaintext
/data                     → Annotated and raw linguistic datasets (e.g., video, gloss, translations)
/images                   → Visuals and illustrations, including avatars and interface elements
/code                     → Core Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and inference
/notebooks                → Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping
/docs                     → Licensing, ethical frameworks, and technical documentation
/streamlit                → Streamlit apps for interactive demos and educational tools
/artificial_intelligence  → Deep learning models, reinforcement learning scripts, and model checkpoints

## 🧭 Vision & Ethics

This repository is a direct response to the **HLT infodemic**—a phenomenon in which SASL is often overlooked, misrepresented, or reduced to hearing-centric interpretations in AI systems. We adopt:

* **Ubuntu ethics**: grounded in community, dignity, and interdependence
* **Inclusive research values**: "Nothing about us without us"
* **Non-commercial development**: for educational, scientific, and community use only

We welcome Deaf contributors, researchers, educators, and ethical technologists.
