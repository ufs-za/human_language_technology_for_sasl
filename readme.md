# 🤟 South African Sign Language Human Language Technology (SASL HLT)

Welcome to the official repository for **South African Sign Language Human Language Technology (SASL HLT)**. This initiative promotes open, inclusive, and ethical development of HLT tools, datasets, and models for SASL. The project is non-commercial and maintained by researchers at the **University of the Free State**, guided by Ubuntu ethics and a commitment to linguistic justice.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This repository is dedicated to the **development, documentation, and open access of SASL HLT** for research, education, and public use. We aim to correct the hearing-centric bias in existing HLT systems by supporting **Deaf-led and inclusive design**. Our work supports community-anchored applications, including the *Lebitso App*, and aligns with principles of linguistic equality and technological equity.

## 🧭 Vision and Values

This repository forms part of our response to the **HLT infodemic** — where existing technologies for sign language are predominantly **hearing-centric** and often exclude Deaf perspectives. We advocate for:

* **Ubuntu Ethics** — recognising interdependence, dignity, and inclusion
* **Nothing About Us Without Us** — prioritising Deaf community leadership
* **Non-Commercial, Public Good** — for learning, research, and community empowerment
